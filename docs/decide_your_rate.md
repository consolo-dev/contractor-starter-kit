import Rate from "@site/src/components/rate";

If you are just getting started contracting, it can be hard to figure out how much to charge per hour. A good way to start thinking about this is from the aspect of what you are getting paid today. Most of the people we interviewed didn't believe they could charge the rates they initially charged, but quickly learned they could charge even more as they proved the value they could provide.

If you are looking to quit your job and start your own agency, this is a baseline to start from. You would need to factor in other benefits such as insurance, equipment, software costs, etc. However, you might want to charge a lower amount at first to build up your portfolio and gain the business skills necessary to go full-time.

Some other important factors in deciding your rate:

- **Experience** - How long have you been doing this kind of work? Do you have a portfolio you can show off? It might be hard to justify to a new client without much to show them that you are worth a high rate. With more experience and a portfolio, you can use your work to show clients you are worth a higher rate. You might also be able to charge an ex-employer more for your services.

- **Location** - Clients are likely used to pricing for their location, e.g. a Startup in San Francisco might expect to pay more than a startup in Pittsburgh for work. Research the local market to see how your rate is comparateively.

#### Value vs Rate

Another key thought around contract work is charging for value vs. amount of work. While you might want to start off by charging an hourly rate, you should learn the amount of value you provide to clients and charge flat rates that match that. As you work on projects, you'll get a better understanding of how much time things take and how clients perceive the work (if they are recommending you to others, you're probably more valuable than what they paid).

There also isn't any shame is saying not to deals because the value isn't there to you. If you have a threshold you need to hit to make contracting worth it, but aren't able to get that in the market, it might not be the right time to get into it.

#### Reach out to Other Contractors

Not sure what people are charging? Know someone else in the space? Reach out to them and ask. All of the contractors we've interviewed were more than happy to help out others in the same position.
