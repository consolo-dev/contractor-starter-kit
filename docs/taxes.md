As a contractor, you are likely to get 1099-K or 1099-MISC from your clients (which they also report to the IRS). 

Even if you are fully employeed, you are considered Self-Employed in the context of your contract work. One of the responsbilities that comes with that is staying on top of your taxes. In order to stay on top of things, you should:

#### Estimate your taxes
You are required to pay the self-employment tax rate (15.3% in 2021) on top of the regular income tax rate. Keep in mind that if you're fully-employed, you should estimate taxes based on your marginal tax bracket because your employer won't be taking this income into consideration.

##### Pay quarterly estimates of your taxes.
You can pay estimated taxes via the [IRS Payment System](https://www.irs.gov/payments/eftps-the-electronic-federal-tax-payment-system). You should pay quarterly to avoid any potential fees.

#### Unlock new deductions
Now that you employ yourself, you can write off business related expenses that the IRS defines as "ordinary and necessary".
