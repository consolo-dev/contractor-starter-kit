#### Taxes

- [TaxSlayer](htps://taxslayer.com) - A cheap tax software to file taxes as a Self-Employed worker. < $100 to file state and federal

- [TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com) - If you already use this, it is a litle more expensive, but might be nice to stay in the same software. 

#### Secure Sharing

- [Privnote](https://privnote.com/) - Send notes that will self destruct after being read (or in a pre determined time period). You can add passwords and get notified when it is read. Make sure to tell the client it will self destruct so they can be sure to copy it locally.
