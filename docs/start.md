# Build your Agency

When first starting to contract, you need to get a couple things in place to protect you and your clients. 

We interviewed a number of part-time and full-time technical contractors to gather all of the resources they found helpful in kickstarting their agency. The top resources they used (or wish they knew to use) can be bucketed in a few categories

1. **Setting Your Rate** - Make sure you are getting paid what you deserve. If you want to make this a full time job, figure out what you need to earn to feel confident in making that leap. 

2. **Contracts** - Don't engage in projects without a contract in place. They don't need to be long legal documents, in fact they can be pretty simple and be enough to cover your in case your client tries to take advantage. 

3. **Taxes** - Make sure to pay your taxes. When you start working as a contractor you are responsible for making quarterly estimated tax payments. Don't be surprised on tax day. 

4. **Software** - There are a lot of tools that can take care of different parts of the process. Consolo is working to bring all these tools together in one place.
