# Build your Agency

When first starting to contract, you need to get a couple things in place to protect you and your clients.

We interviewed a number of part-time and full-time technical contractors to gather all of the resources they found helpful in kickstarting their agency. The top resources they used (or wish they knew to use) can be bucketed in a few categories:

1. **Setting Your Rate** - Make sure you are getting paid what you deserve. If you want to make this a full time job, figure out what you need to earn to feel confident in making that leap.

2. **Contracts** - Don't engage in projects without a contract in place. They don't need to be long legal documents, in fact they can be pretty simple and be enough to cover your in case your client tries to take advantage.

3. **Taxes** - Make sure to pay your taxes. When you start working as a contractor you are responsible for making quarterly estimated tax payments. Don't be surprised on tax day.

4. **Software** - There are a lot of tools that can take care of different parts of the process. Consolo is working to bring all these tools together in one place.

##### We also wanted to highlight some of the top tips they provided:

1. Don't jump in too hard early on. Start with 1 project at a time, don't fill all of your extra time in the day. You'll likely work more than you expected and can burn yourself out easily.

2. It's not rude to say no. When people ask you to do work, some may expect it for free. Some clients might come back and ask for you to make "just some little changes" after you've delivered and been paid. It's not rude to ask for payment for your services, your time is valuable. Setting a minimum amount for any job can be helpful.

3. It's okay to be out of someones budget. In reality, some clients don't have a realistic grasp on what to pay for work. They might be shocked when you give them a quote, that is likely more a problem on their side than yours.

4. Don't compromise quality for a lower price. You may give a quote that a client asks you to do it cheaper. Rather than say yes and offer ways to cut corners, explain why that isn't a good idea. There is a reason they came to you with the job, stand behind your quality.

5. Always get a deposit. Even with a contract in place it's important for them to invest money up front. Make sure that money is paid before you start the work.

6. Don't half-ass your scope of work. Just a simple list of things like "Website, Email Accounts" aren't going to cut it. Give details on all aspects of the work. If you can, set reasonable deliverables that require payment so you aren't expecting all of the money at the end.

7. Communication is really important. When things aren't clear, always ask for more details and ask those questions in a thoughful manner to ellicit the right response. When you are sending a proposal, be sure to communicate that you understand what they're looking for and how you can solve the problem(s). Answer any emails/questions promptly.

8. Don't forget to promote yourself. Just like any job, more time and experience means you should make more money. There are plenty of ways to increase your rate, but be sure you are considering the upward trajectory. You can also adjust rates in accordance to inflation, just like every other company.
