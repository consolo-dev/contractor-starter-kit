As a solo-preneur, you likely want to create a Sole Proprietorship, meaning you are the sole entity of the business and will be operating under your name. This does mean that you are personally tied to the business, so you assume full liablity of the business. 

To operate under your legal name, you aren't required to create a legal business entity. 

However, if you want your business to operate under a name that isn't your legal name, you may need to file a DBA (Doing Business As).  This process is different from state to state, so check your local regulations. 

1. Pick the name you want your business to operate under and ensure it isn't already trademarked with the [USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks)

2. File your DBA if needed.
